<div class="instructor_note">Point everyone to this document and explain how it will be updated at the end of the day with any changes that are required after the workshop.</div>

## Key Workshop Objectives
- Understand the basic structure of a Latex document
- Understand the typical Latex workflow
- Get you to a point where you feel confident using and experimenting with Latex on your own!

## Workshop Overview
- *Why* use Latex?
- *How* Latex works (and the typical workflow)
- Overleaf: What it is and why you might want to use it
- Basic Latex structure
- Working with sections, chapters etc.
- Organizing your files
- Figures
- Math Mode
- References and citations
- UoA thesis template
- Working with packages
- Handy tools and links

## Why use Latex? What's wrong with Word?
- Prevalence in academic literature
- Working with large files
- Professional looking typeset documents!
    - Equations easily in the various math modes
    - Tables, graphs and figures using `TikZ`, `PGF-Plots` vector graphics
    - Can even automatically populate these graphs and figures using your existing research data (e.g. with `csv` files)
    - Working with non-Latin scripts (Arabic, Sanskrit etc.)
- Not just used for academic literature
    - Academic journal articles, books, CVs, presentations, posters
    - Check out [the gallery here](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/academic-journal) for all sorts of examples

## Typical Workflow
Do your writing in a Latex `.tex` file + Bibliography `.bib` file *(optional)* → Run the files through a Latex `distribution` (sometimes called a `compiler`) → Outputs a PDF

This is a different way of working to WYSIWYG editors like Microsoft Word. Some people claim this allows you to focus more on your content than its appearance. On the other hand your writing now has Latex specific commands intermingled with it.

## Latex Editors
These are what you actually do your writing in. Because Latex is written in plain text, if you wanted to (and plenty of people do) you could use a simple text editor like Notepad to do your writing, and then run the Latex `distribution` (the software that takes all your Latex files and outputs a PDF) yourself.

However, this is unnecessarily complicated and newer Latex editors provide lots of nice features like spell checking, code higlighting, and autocompletion.

You *must* have a Latex distribution installed on your computer to be able to `build` your Latex files.  [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) and [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) are by far the most popular. On most Linux distributions and Mac OS Latex comes preinstalled. Then go ahead and download the editor of your choosing.

My personal recommendations for desktop Latex editors:

1. TeXstudio
2. TeXmaker
3. Texworks

However a more recent development in the Latex world is **web based** Latex editors. This is what we will be using today.

## Overleaf
Overleaf is a modern web based Latex editor that allows you to work on Latex documents anywhere in the world without needing to install any software, all you need is your browser (although you need an active Internet connection).

Because it is a web based tool, it also has some other helpful features that you typically don't get from desktop-based editors, the most useful of which are:

- Live `recompiling`: Your changes are automatically reflected in the PDF preview as you're working on them
- Collaboration: Overleaf allows you to share your Latex projects with other users. This is especially useful for working with co-authors and/or sharing your papers with your supervisors as you're working on them 

Overleaf has a free plan. However for full features they charge a monthly fee. Half price plans are available to students. In my opinion the only major limting feature of the free plan is that it only allows you to share your document with a single collaborator. Provided this isn't a deal breaker, the free plan still provides heaps of features and allows you to create unlimited private projects.

## Basic Latex

<div class="instructor_note">Explain how Latex documents are a mixture of commands and content. Explain what commands look like.</div>

Every Latex document is comprised of a mixture of Latex commands and your actual content. Almost all Latex commands follow the exact same structure:

```tex
\command[optional arguments]{arguments}
```

Note the backslash (`\`) that precedes commands. This is what lets Latex know that everything following the backslash (up until the next space) should be interpreted as being a Latex command, rather than just ordinary content.

Almost all Latex commands take `arguments`. This is the information that you 'pass' to the command, to tell it what to do. For example:

```tex
This text would appear formatted normally, but \textbf{this text would appear bold}.
```

The above command would appear in your PDF as:

<div class="output">
This text would appear formatted normally, but <b>this text would appear bold</b>.
</div>

In the example above, the command `\textbf{}` tells Latex to **bold** anything that appears between the two curly-braces `{}`.

<div class="note">
The bf in <span class="manual-code">\textbf{}</span> stands for boldface, a technical term for bolded text. Similarly <span class="manual-code">\textit{}</span> makes text italic.
</div>

### Latex Document Structure
Every Latex document follows the same structure:

```
Preamble Commands
 - This is where you do things like specify:
    - The document type: e.g. whether it's a book or a journal article, and one or two columns
    - The document title and author(s)
    - List any packages you want to use (more on this later)
----
Document Content
- This is where you actually put the content of your document, and is generally divided into different chapters and/or sections, or in Latex terms 'environments'
```

In actual Latex, this is what it looks like:

```tex
\documentclass[twocolumn]{article}
\title{My first Latex document}
\author{Sam Kavangah}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
This is the actual body of the document, this text would appear in the PDF.
\end{document}
```

That above code is a **complete** and valid Latex document. That is all you need! Latex will take care of sorting out all the default margins and for you. It even generates a nice title, author, and date section for you based on the information you provided in the document `preamble` (i.e. the stuff that came before the `begin{document}` command).

If you were to paste the above code into Overleaf, you would see the following output PDF:

<img class="screenshot bordered"  src="/assets/workshops/latex/screenshot_first_document.png" alt="Screenshot First Document" />

The text only goes halfway across the page because we specified that this was a `twocolumn` document in the following Latex command:

```tex
\documentclass[twocolumn]{article}
```

This is an example of an **optional** argument, why is why it appears in `[]`. You could have instead simply written:

```tex
\documentclass{article}
```

and your document would have defaulted to a single column article.
